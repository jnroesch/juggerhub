# Specification Quality Checklist: Home dashboard & top-level navigation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Scope, backend depth, and event-type handling were decided up front with the product owner
  (one combined feature; real backend for Up next / Tournaments / News from existing sources;
  Notifications, League news, and a unified activity feed deferred; no new event types). These
  are recorded in Assumptions and Out of Scope, so no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed.
- The spec references existing domain concepts (events, sign-ups, team news) by name for
  traceability; the *how* (endpoints, entities, components) is deferred to plan.md.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
